  - The Rust compiler is very complicated. It consists of many modules, and it takes multiple steps to translate a human-readable programming language to a machine code. Though it's not necessary for typical programmers to know the internals of the compiler, it'd be very helpful if we understand how the language works.

  - Have you used attributes in the Rust language? Maybe yes, but probably never defined one. Though you don't have to define attributes in most cases, sometimes new attributes give you a very powerful and flexible set of skills.

  - It's the second article of the Rust smart pointers series. This time, it's vectors. If you're writting code in Rust, there's no way you can avoid using this type. Knowing the internals of one of the most frequently used type will improve our code a lot!

  - Rust is a low-level language. That means you can (and have to) manipulate the data at the byte level when using the language.

  - Reference-counting pointers are one of the most widely used smart pointers. It dynamically tracks the lifetime of an object, and decides when to destruct the item.

  - Lifetime is one of the most important concept in the Rust world. It guarantees that a pointer is always pointing to a valid memory.
