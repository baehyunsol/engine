# Counting Stars

I counted stars of github repositories by their language, just for fun!

Here is how I did it.

1. Goto github's [advanced search] menu.
1. Set `written in this language` option to the language I want.
1. Set `with this many stars` option to `> 2000`.

The number of the repositories is a rough approximation of the size of the open-source community of each language.

Most of the top repositories are Python learning materials, not softwares. It tells us that Python is a loved language for beginners.
