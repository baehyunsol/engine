# Welcome to my blog!

I'm Baehyunsol. I'm a student at [Seoul National University]. I'm currently interested in the [Rust] programming language.

This blog uses [MDxt], my custom Markdown Extension. If you wanna know more about it, visit the links below.

This blog is optimized for the Firefox browser. Well, I didn't mean it: my blog adheres to the html5 specification. But firefox is the only browser that supports all the html5 features that I'm using. If you wanna know more about it, read [this](Browser-Compatibility.html) article.
