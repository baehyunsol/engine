# Browser Compatibility Comparison

I always try my best to fit my blog into the HTML5 specification. But what if the browsers do not support the spec? I suddenly got worried about it and I decided to do the test by myself.

## Browsers

I must include 3 major browsers: firefox, chrome and safari. I only tested on PC, not mobile. Since each browser uses the same engine for both platforms, the compatibility issue between two must be minor. I didn't include the Edge browser because it uses the Chrome's engine. I excluded Samsung Internet, Brave and many other browsers for the same reason.

I also tested on minor *or* outdated browsers: IE, ladybird, servo and netsurf. They all use their own engine, all built from scratch.

- Firefox
  - Version 106.0 on Windows 10
  - tested on 2022/10/20
- Chrome
  - Version 106.0.5249.119 on Windows 10
  - tested on 2022/10/20
- Safari
  - Not tested yet
- IE
  - Version 11.0.19041.1566 on Windows 10
  - tested on 2022/10/20, but that doesn't matter at all: IE's not maintained anymore
- Ladybird
  - Not tested yet
- NetSurf
  - Version 3.10 on Windows 10
  - tested on 2022/10/20
- Servo
  - Version ?? on Windows 10
  - tested on 2022/10/20

[^ct]: It uses JS' DOM API to control CSS variables. CSS `color` has a transition effect.

[^cbf]: It uses JS' clipboard API.

[^tlcm]: It only uses CSS to draw the marker.

[^bb]: It uses CSS: `backdrop-filter: blur(5px);`.

[^alsm]: It uses CSS `justify-content` and `align-items`.

[^ctwa]: It uses basic JS DOM API and CSS transitions.

[^iee1]: It renders the shape correctly, but I can't see it due to issues with colors.

[^nse1]: I failed to change the theme because I can't open the settings menu with it.

[^nse2]: I can't see the markers because the browser doesn't support CSS variables. I changed the colors with dev-tools on IE, but this browser doesn't have dev-tools.

[^nse3]: I can't check it because it doesn't open the image viewer. I guess it doesn't support JS at all.

[^nse4]: I can't open the settings menu.

[^specialchars]: Renders [this page](MDxt-Character-Reference.html) properly.

[^nse5]: [[char=cong]] is too small to read.

[^sve1]: I can't open the settings menu.
